         <p id="aboutMe"> Welcome: My name is Brendon Hart, and I am an 18 year-old who still isn't quite sure about the path that I want to take in my life. I graduated high school following my sophomore year, and decided to take a break from school before pursueing a full-time school occupation. I was born in Littleton, Colorado, and have yet to live outside of the state. I currently live in Elizabeth, Colorado, and I can safely say that living in the suburbans is not for me! <br>
          <br>

          I have shown interest in attending a course hosted by the University of Denver, and stumbled across an online ad for this course. After some research following the discovery, I decided that a web developer position may be well within my ability, as I've always had a passion for computers. I am beyond excited to continue absorbing all that this course has to offer, and so far I have yet to be dissapointed. I thrive in fast-paced, stressful environments so I am excited!
