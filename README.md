# **Description**

This assignment serves and my portfolio, and it's creation will help me organize my completed projects as well as give employers some insight into who I am as as a developer, and the skills that I possess. 

My main page titled "About Me" (index.html) serves to provide an employer with my experience, background, as well as the fact that I thrive in stressful environments. 

On the page titled "Portfolio" (portfolio.html) allows employers to get a glimpse of some of my past completed projects, along with a brief description of each one. For the time being, I have left all six photos with blank shutterstock images, but that will change as I progress through my Boot Camp. 

The page titled "Contact Me" (contact.html) serves to provide employers - as well as anyone else viewing my page - with an oppertunity to reach out to me. There are fields within a form labeled 'Email', 'Name', as well as 'Message".

# **Installation**

N/A

# **Usage**

Using the navbar, select the page you would like to view. No further instructions are needed to navigate my website.

# **Technologies Used**

Within this website, there are components from html, css styling, as well as css BootStrap. 
Using HTML, I was able to lay the basic format for my page using BootStraps grid system. HTML also allowed me to place elements such as the navbar and cards. 

Using basic CSS Styling, I was able to change text color, background color, font size, as well as add outlines anywhere I thought neccessary. Standard fonts were used. 

Using CSS BootStrap, I was able to fully take advantage of the grid system, using columns to format my pages. BootStrap also allowed me to get the basic code for applying a navvbar, cards, and a form. 

# **Problems Faced**

There was a brief issue attempting to layout the cards using the column formatting on the page titled "Portfolio", and that issue was resolved by adding another card in the row. 

It was difficult to get the Footer to remain fixed at the bottom of the page, until I used the CSS Style position:fixed.

I would like to learn to take advantage of the data being entered into the form on the "Contact Me" page. 

# **Credits**

Though this website was created by me, it was only done so using knowledge provided by my instructor, TA's, my tutor, as well as many of my classmates.
